natural selection evolutionary algorithm

  calculating dps
wiki

  base of natural selection
most dps
consistent dps
burst dps
average of all 3

  spread on some passing of genes (pass a string of params used to generate a rotation, not pass a rotation)
ability priority random weight m
ability sequence chaining (chaining a certain ability 1-5 gcds after another certain one)
# of hits
special attack?
damage
ability duration in ticks
cooldown in ticks

select random abilities and place in 2d array until sum of total >= fightDuration
create a 2d matrix with multipliers according to first array (needle in array[6] increases array[7] by .7%)
create a matrix alongside abilities as theyre chosen with adren values

find efficient way to generate real-complete dps rotations
add ability to array1
add adren to array2
add multiplier operations to array3 if applicable
add addition operations to array4 if applicable
add status to array5
